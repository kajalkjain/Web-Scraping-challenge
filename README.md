# Web-Scraping-challenge

The challenge required me to use splinter and beautiful soup objects to scrape a web page and extract titles and preview. Additional challenge is to read the web page with weather data, whihc was in a tabular format. It also provided me an opportunity to refresh Python - panda code knoeledge, which we did few modules ago. 

Over all the experience was good.
